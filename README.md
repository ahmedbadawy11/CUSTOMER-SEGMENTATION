## Overview

Customer segmentation is a critical component of modern business strategy, allowing companies to understand and cater to the diverse needs of their clientele effectively. This project delves into the analysis of transactional data to identify distinct customer segments based on their behavior and characteristics. By employing RFM analysis and clustering algorithms, we aim to partition the customer base into cohesive groups, enabling personalized marketing approaches and efficient resource allocation. 💼💡

## Key Features

### RFM Analysis

- Utilized RFM metrics – Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value – to evaluate customer behavior and preferences. This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of each customer's engagement and spending patterns. 📅💰

### Data Description

- Provided an overview of the transactional dataset, including key features such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country. Understanding the data structure is essential for conducting meaningful analysis and interpretation. 📋🔍

### Data Understanding

- Explored the dataset to identify patterns and trends, including the distribution of missing values, duplicates, negative quantities, and customer demographics. This step lays the foundation for subsequent data preprocessing and analysis tasks. 📊🔍

### Data Preprocessing

- Implemented rigorous data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing anomalies, to ensure data quality and model performance. This step is crucial for obtaining reliable insights from the dataset. 🛠️🧹

### Feature Engineering

- Created new features such as "Total Price" to enhance the analysis of transactional data. Feature engineering enables the extraction of valuable information from raw data, improving the effectiveness of clustering algorithms. 📈✨
